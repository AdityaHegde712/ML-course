The ML process:
* Data preprocessing
    -Import and clean dataset
    -Split into training and test sets
* Modelling
    -Building the model
    -Training the model
    -Making the predictions or doing the classifications
* Evaluation
    -Calculate performance metrics
    -Make a verdict on that

About feature scaling:
You always apply feature scaling to a column individually, not across columns.
This is because if you scale all of your features at once then it will make them more comparable
which can cause overfitting in some cases (especially when using linear regression).

Normalization - (Value - min)/(max - min), between 0 and 1
Standardisation - (Value - min)/average, between -3 and 3 usually
